# ↯⚡ Bolt ⚡↯

Bolt is more of an idea than an implementation - which is to give text super
powers by making it possible to *evaluate* it. Bolt lets you declare *what* you
want to do rather than doing the work yourself. This project is a playground
that uses emacs and bash scripts to implement these ideas.
